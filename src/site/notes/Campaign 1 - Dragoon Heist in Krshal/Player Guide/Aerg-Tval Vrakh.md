Aerg-Tval Vrakh served as the [[Campaign 1 - Dragoon Heist in Krshal/Player Guide/Lord of Chains\|Lord of Chains]] during the 10th century (9.56-9.89). He is most famous for expanding the city to the eastern side of the Yrann river and defending this expansion against the retaliation of a Troll horde that used to occupy the land. Perhaps chief amongst his achievements was killing the Troll overlord Grimsoul with his bare hands, thus giving rise to the name ‘Grimsoul Trunk’ for which the battleground was later named. His death two years after these events came as a direct result of injuries he received at the hands of the Troll warrior. His family have held a seat on the Krshalian council ever since.
