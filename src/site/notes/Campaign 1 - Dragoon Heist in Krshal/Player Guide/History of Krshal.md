Krshal is a port city on the coast of the Krpathian continent. A sprawling encampment, originally settled in mythology by twin brothers Krsque and Shalvk, along the estuary at the mouth of the Yrann river, their modest township eventually blossomed into a thriving port over many centuries. Through their good management of the local flora and fauna, the Krshalians grew their industries exponentially in this period, not only becoming the biggest exporters of Salted Blobfish but the most renowned tanners of all types of leather, including Grick and Auroch. This economic growth obviously brought wealth and affluence to the area, to its noble families in particular, but it also brought crime and poverty for its less fortunate citizens. As a result, Krshal is today not only a hive city of pirates, thugs, thieves and ne’er-do-wells who plague the law abiding yeomanry and peasants alike, but a den of ravenous plutocrats all fixated on the ‘grand game’ of power and wealth playing out within the city walls. Naturally, the city has become a playground for both those looking to make their name and those born with one.

As a democratic city-state, Krshal is unique in the region insofar as its citizenry are plucked at random to serve on a 500 person council of state for life. This can happen at any time in a citizen’s life and the councillors can come from any strata of society. New councillors are elected upon the death (or sometimes disappearance) of previous councillors. Their job is to advise and serve the [[Campaign 1 - Dragoon Heist in Krshal/Player Guide/Lord of Chains\|Lord of Chains]], the lord of Krshal, who is also elected for life. Given the term lengths involved, over the centuries political power has centralised in the hands of a few shadowy families that have gathered the means and resources to ensure the continued election of their family line to the council (and even to the seat of the Lordship itself). At one point in the 8th century, there were 127 members of the Cassalanter family in the council at the same time.
