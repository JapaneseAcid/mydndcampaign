The Lord of Chains is the name given to the elected Lord of Krshal. They are elected for life through a city wide election and can only be replaced through death. Numerous times this has resulted in embittered sons stabbing aging fathers in the back to trigger an election they will inevitably lose (Krshalians generally take a dim view of Patricide but are usually quite apathetic towards Regicide itself). Once a Lord of Chains has died, the city enters a mourning period, which is usually ignored except in cases of a beloved Lord passing, and the council petitions a funeral collection, which is also usually ignored resulting in most Lordsâ€™ families having to shell out for the funeral costs themselves. This apathy is usually felt both ways with most Lords ending up despotic rulers, given that they have the seat for life, and most are simply out to enrich themselves either legally or illegally, whichever is most expeditious. Chainlord Dagult Vrahk is most recently rumoured to have secreted half a million golden dragoons of the public purse somewhere in the city to reclaim once his banishment is expunged.
