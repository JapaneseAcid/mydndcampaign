Your party arrived in Krshal in search of Petulia Rainwater, a contact given to you by Jacque. 

You arrived at the Yawning Portal but couldn’t find Petulia and you assumed she must have been waylaid. Maybe she will track you down at a later date! You did, however, meet the tavernkeep, Durnan, a renowned adventurer of old, and you also met Yagra Stonefist, a half-orc who seemed friendly.

After dispatching a Troll, you met Volothamp Geddarm, a local celebrity about town. He asked if you’d help find his missing friend Floon Blaagmar for a reward.

Investigating the trail, you came across the City Watch and learnt more about the gang warfare plaguing the city. So far, you’ve met members of the Xanatar gang and the Zhentarim gang, who are sometimes known as the Doom Raiders.

You also came across a knick knack shop called Ye Olde Xoblob Shoppe where Gloom got a bronze pentacle with a rats head inlay that seemed to be helpful against curses or hauntings. Pussuid bought a multicoloured stone disk for a bargain price! Garrett bought a soldier’s medal and a glass, smoke filled orb - could there be a soul inside? 

After finding where Floon, and his friend Renaer Vrakh the son of the previous and currently exiled ChainLord of Krshal, were taken on Candle Lane by Zhentarim thugs with their black armour and winged snake tattoos, the gang fought off a gaggle of Kenku and rescued Renaer from his bonds hidden inside a storage cupboard. In doing so, you found 300gp worth of paintings (4xlandscapes) and 750gp worth of silver trade-bars. You also discovered Renaer’s locket upstairs in the warehouse, revealing a hidden compartment. Renaer reckoned the Xanathar thugs who had left it behind when they raided Zhent warehouse were looking for the *Stone of Golorr* inside, rumoured to be the key to finding the 500,000 hidden Krshalian Dragoons, although he never even knew it had a secret compartment to begin with!

Taking Renaer with you, you found your way into the sewers and managed to track the Xanathar Eyeball Markings to one of their numerous bases. Making your way through, killing a Duergar and Krentz in the process who had earlier started a fight with Yagra in the Yawning Portal, you found Floon at the mercy of an apprentice wizard named Grum’Shar. In the service of a retreating Mind Flayer, Grum’Shar remained to fight you off but fell to a Pussuid axe stroke. He left behind a spell book containing the following spells: _Burning Hands_, _Disguise Self_, _False Life_, _Shield_, _Unseen Servant_, and _Witch Bolt_, and tucked behind a stone chair, you also found a small, unlocked wooden chest containing two _potions of healing_, 16gp, 82sp, and 250cp. 

Upon returning with Floon to the Yawning Portal, Volo greeted you as friends and heroes, bestowing upon you the deed to your very own mansion in TrollSkull Alley! He plans to take you on a tour of the city next time before dropping you off at your new abode…
