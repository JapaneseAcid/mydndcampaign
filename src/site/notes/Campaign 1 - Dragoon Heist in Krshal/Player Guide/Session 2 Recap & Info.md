Following on from the first session, Volo took the party on a tour of Krshal’s old town with Renaer Vrakh before gifting them the deed for Troll Skull Manor. He had the deed signed by a magistrar and Renaer covered the 25gp magistration fee as thanks for rescuing him and Floon. 

Entering Troll Skull Alley, Volo noted the local businesses and the bustling street full of life. The Manor itself was in a ruinous state though and appeared visibly rough around the edges; it’s in need of some hefty repairs!

Upon entering the house, the party discovered the ground floor had been turned into some kind of tavern long ago and, although in a terrible state of repair, appeared to have very good bones indeed. The bar was well built, if a bit shabby, and the door was clearly built by a master craftsman. Petulia found a 21 year old bottle of Dragon’s Breath amongst the bottles on the bar shelves distilled in her home region of Khillsfaer (pronounced Hills-Far).

Whilst exploring the ground floor, the party saw the ghost of a half-elf barman and a small boy in the kitchen. They also managed to clear out the basement of swarms of rats and spiders; although they took some hefty damage in the process! Here, Petulia found another bottle; this time an elvish wine called Elverquisst, also worth a pretty penny! In this part of the basement, the party found an alcove decorated with a bas-relief of a snarling, three-eyed dog. It seemed to have been vandalised by deep gouges, zig-zagging lines, and overlapping circles.

Gaining entry to the second floor took some force from Pussuid’s hefty bosom, but the group managed to gain entry through the locked door without alerting anyone to their presence. 

In the Solarium, Aendwyn found a crystal globe that can be used in winter months to provide sunlight for growing plants. In the corridor, Pussuid saw a grim visage of a man peaking through the cracks in the walls and laughing hysterically. As the visage disappeared, a flyer for a brothel fell slowly to the floor at her feet. As she continued down the corridor, she entered a bedroom where she first met a Tressym, a winged and scarred cat-like creature which hissed at her and flew off immediately.

Upon entering the third floor Library, the players were assaulted by two spectres who gave them a tough fight in which Keene Fita Oné was knocked unconscious. Pussuid tried breaking a hole in the wall to weaken the spirits, to some success, but Petulia’s Thunder spell dealt with them most effectively. Finally slain, they burst into globs of slimy ectoplasm on the floor which Pussuid and Aendwyn scooped into their pockets for some reason. Pussuid also pocketed a small animal skull in the room; a link to the spectres perhaps? 

After dealing with the ghosts, the party found The Alcaister of En-Hedu, a hefty tome that seemed very important but which none of the party could discern anything about. Inside they found strange ramblings scrawled into the margins, clearly written by someone in deep distress. They then entered the Manor’s turret where they found strange and disturbing drawings on the walls of the upper room. Here they heard the faint cries of a man pleading for ‘my son, my son, my son!’

From here, they came back down into a bedroom where they found an Adder Stone. Pussuid knew all about this from her childhood stories; it is a a very valuable and rare stone with a hole in the centre that can be used to see through in order to see things invisible to the naked eye. Hewn from a Basilisk tooth by running water over centuries, the stone is a very powerful tool indeed. The letter ‘L’ was scrawled on it but Pussuid took ownership of it herself by scratching a ‘P’ over the top of it.

In the attic, the group found a silver ornate mirror lying face down. Petulia noticed it was a skilled fey creation and had a deeply magical aura. Kween Fita Oné lifted the mirror up to reveal a horrifying Hag reflected behind her, snarling with yellow, rotting, and broken teeth, reaching out to her with fingers peeled back to the bone at their tip.

Interrupting the tension, a knock at the door brought the party back to earth, literally and figuratively. At the door, they met Broxley Fairkettle, the spokesman for the Fellowship of Innkeepers, the local guild in charge of tavern affairs. He fave them a rough estimate of tavern repair costs and informed them of the dangers of trying to circumvent Krshalian Guilds and their methods. They discussed  rough deal but didn’t want to commit to anything without their partners consent; Broxley will return within the week to hammer out a deal!

Whilst walking their new neighbourhood, they stopped in at Frewn’s Brews for a drink. Confronted by a rather rude and insulting chap called Emmek Frewn, the group learnt that he wanted to buy the Manor House originally but was pipped by Volo at the auction. He resents the new owners before even meeting them; offering an insultingly lowball offer for the deed to the house. Aendwyn tried to intimidate and even hit Emmek but he was having none of it; he ordered them out of his small hovel of a tavern!

The group then went to Book Wyrm’s Treasure and met a very distinguished Dragonborn man named Rishaal. Through their discussion with him, the group learnt that Rishaal knew a half-elf who used to run the tavern at Troll Skull Manor named Lifandran. They were friends but had a falling out over Lif wanting help with some rather troubling research he was undertaking. Rishaal recounts how this pushed Lif into the hands of Vincent Trench, a rather shadowy figure in the alley who Rishaal hates. 

Learning about the ghostly sightings inside the Manor, Rishaal is horrified to learn about what is going on inside and what he thinks might be Lif’s spirit trapped there. He offers to help the party research anything they can find in his shop to help them sort out the nasty goings on inside their new home. After an afternoon of hard research, Petulia, helped by her new friends, found out some worrying info about Hags and what they might be encountering.

Exhausted, Rishaal had to turn in for the night so the gang decided to visit Ye Olde Xoblob Shoppe to peruse the shelves. They bought what they think might be a troll skull for 63gp there; it could match a missing ornament space they found within Troll Skull Manor earlier on! 

Kween Fita Oné also bought a purple handkerchief with the embroidered initials of the exiled and shamed Ex-Chainlord of Krshal, Lord Dagult Vrahk, on it for 1gp. 

Upon returning to Troll Skull Alley, headed for their beds, the party saw the Tressym from earlier outside the front door. Pussuid managed to calm the beast initially before it flew off again up onto the roof. Perhaps she’ll be able to tame it with a couple more attempts?
